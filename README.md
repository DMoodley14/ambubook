# ambubook

An online ambulance booking platform developed with Flutter and Firebase.
Initially purposed for Limpopo Department of Health. 

Problem: Emergency interfacility transport of patients is currently being booked using a telephone. Often issues such as telephone lines being offline, poor signal, and a language barrier make it difficult to book the correct transport. 

Solution: Ambubook was developed as an answer to this problem. Clinicians at a referring facility can enter anonymized patient details such as blood pressure, temperature, the reason for transfer, etc. The info is compiled into a form and sent to the ambulance station via email or sms (not currently in use). 

Benefits: 
- The correct information is being transferred
- If telephone lines are down, the service is still running
- Documentation is ensured
- A reminder sms system can be setup to ensure timely transfers
- A perceived improvement of LDOH

Possible Drawbacks:
- Still relies on internet connection (email) and cellular signal (sms)
- Cybersecurity
- Relies on uptake from staff
